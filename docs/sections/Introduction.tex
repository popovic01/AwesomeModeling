\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:in}
This project was undertaken by a group of Computer Engineering students enrolled in the master's
course Software Platforms at the University of Padua. The primary objective of the project is
to build a platform for monitoring articles from online newspapers, storing them in a database,
making them searchable through a search server, and extracting representations of themes discussed
in a set of articles returned as results for a given query.

Newspaper articles are fetched from the Guardian API, saved in MongoDB, made searchable via
Elasticsearch, and analyzed using Mallet for topic modeling. Additionally, the project aims to
implement microservices architecture. It comprises two services that communicate with each otherâ€”one
built in Spring and the other in Python.

The documentation is divided into the following chapters: Chapter \ref{ch:met}, which describes
the main concepts and technologies used.
