\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:in}
This project was developed by a group of Computer Engineering students enrolled in the master's
course Software Platforms at the University of Padova. The primary objective of the project is
to build a platform for downloading articles from online newspapers, storing them in a database,
making them searchable through a search server, and extracting representations of topics discussed
in a set of articles returned as results for a given query.

Newspaper articles are fetched from the Guardian API, saved in MongoDB, made searchable via
Elasticsearch, and analyzed using Mallet for topic modeling.
Additionally, the project aims at
implementing a microservices architecture.

The application comprises a variety of services, that communicate with each-other.


The documentation is divided into the following chapters: Chapter~\ref{ch:design},
which describes the technologies used and the design for the overall system, Chapter~\ref{ch:designPerService} which describes the design
 for each service individually, Chapter~\ref{ch:motivation}, which outlines the motivation
 for the specific design choices, Chapter~\ref{ch:depl}, which explains the deployment
 of the microservices and Chapter~\ref{ch:repr},
 which explains the steps to run the application. Finally, Chapter~\ref{ch:testing}
 discusses the way we tested the application.
