\section{Reproducibility}
\label{ch:repr}

To run the application an user would only need to
\begin{itemize}
        \item install Docker and Docker Compose on its machine;
        \item run \texttt{docker compose up --build}
\end{itemize}

Docker Compose will take care of downloading all the base images,
building all the images specified in the \textit{Dockerfile} file
and spinning up all the containers.

The API will be available at \textit{http://localhost:8080} and the
front-end at \textit{http://localhost:8082}.
